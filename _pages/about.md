Wei Yao is currently a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Computer Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), and co-advised by Professor [Guiling (Grace) Wang](https://web.njit.edu/~gwang/) and Professor [Fadi P. Deek](https://people.njit.edu/faculty/deek) .

**Research interest:** I have a broad spectrum of interests in blockchain consensus, decentralized applications, and the design and analysis of cryptograhpic protocols. In particular, my research aims at solving those key issues preventing the blockchain from being widely used in practice.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
