As Intelligent Transportation Systems and Connected Vehicles become increasingly prevalent, establishing secure, efficient, and scalable communication infrastructures has become imperative. This paper introduces iBCTrans, a novel framework designed specifically for Cellular Vehicular-to-Everything (C-V2X) Networks, leveraging a blockchain-based approach to address the challenges in vehicular communication scenarios. iBCTrans integrates blockchain technology with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to facilitate secure and trustworthy V2X applications among vehicles, infrastructure, and networks. In this framework, vehicles can authenticate their identities in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the communication. A detailed overview of the iBCTrans architecture, components, protocols, and workflows is presented and potential applications in various vehicular communication scenarios are discussed. The proposed iBCTrans framework aims to provide a robust solution for the emerging demands of V2X communications, paving the way for the next generation of intelligent vehicular networks.
