Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an evolving means of identity management that aims to give individuals more control over their digital identities and personal data rather than relying on third-party organizations or government authorities. Blockchain technology has the potential to strengthen SSI significantly by providing a secure and decentralized method towards managing and storing personal data, rendering them resistant to tampering and also enhancing their privacy. Given the diversity of blockchain-based SSI platforms, including Sovrin, uPort, and Hyperledger Indy, it is essential to have a consistent approach to evaluate the different SSI systems consistently. This paper offers guidelines for building systematic architecture and defining comprehensive internal interactions for a complete SSI system, thereby providing a framework for routine evaluation and analysis of an existing SSI platform and establishing base standards for assessing capability, compatibility and interoperability of SSI systems. Accordingly, the paper also reports on comprehensive experiments over many existing blockchain-based SSI systems using a multi-layered approach.
